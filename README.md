#### 👋 Hi there, I'm Alp Mete!


## 🚀 About Me

I’m a passionate 17 year old backend developer with a deep love for building scalable, efficient applications. My coding journey began at 6 years old, and before my 7th birthday, I had already built a line-following robot. Since then, I’ve been competing in robotics tournaments across multiple countries, staying curious and hungry for more!

## ✨ Fun Fact

I started coding before I learned to tie my shoes 👟 — now I build robots that could probably do it for me.
